Along with crypto currencies the Blockchain has inspired innovations in cloud storage. A number of startups have entered the space with more sure to follow. Sia, Storj, Filecoin, and Maidsafe are the largest projects I have found to date and the ones I will be introducing to you here.

Sia (SIA) is a blockchain startup headquartered in Boston Massachusetts. They are promising to reinvent could storage and their stated hope is: "â€¦to become the backbone storage layer of the internet". Their storage technology breaks your files apart into fragments and uploads it to the Sia network where its spread to 30 different hosts. Two thirds of those hosts can go offline before you lose access to your data. Unlike consumer cloud storage, all data on the Sia network is encrypted and secure. Smart contracts are made for hosts and renters that determine pricing and uptime commitments. These contracts are executed off chain in a method similar to bitcoins lightning network. This means that Sias on chain token transactions will not be impacted by storage micro transactions. As a disincentive to go offline or tamper with data, hosts are required to stake Sia against the storage contract.

Storj (STORJ) - Storj is a blockchain based, peer to peer cloud storage system. Their software is open source and they are heavily  developer and community oriented. Head quartered in Atlanta Georgia with offices in Salt Lake City Utah, the Storj team work on the fully open source code and lead the thriving Storj community. Storj uses a simple pricing model that makes small payments to farmers and chargers renters small fees monthly and per GB downloaded. Storj is very easy to setup and get started and holds a lot of promise for average consumers and enterprises alike. They are directly challenging amazon and market themselves as a competitor to cloud storage providers like amazon, priced competitively against their (AWS S3) offering.

Filecoin(FIL) - Filecoin is the token for a decentralized storage network. Along with the Inter planetary file system Filecoin will allow users to store data at hyper competitive prices. They will use an ask and bid system to marketize the storage contracts on the Filecoin network. The best rates will go to the miners in big cities with high bandwidth, low latency connections. The Filecoin market will have a complex pricing scheme that will balance redundancy, speed of retrieval, to suit their needs.

MaidSafe (Massive Array of Internet Disks Secure Access For Everyone) - The world's first autonomous data network, is the claimed title of the open source Blockchain storage project.  Still in the early development of their network their technology promises to truly create a new world wide web. Apart from other Blockchain storage projects MaidSafe is also building a webhosting manager, browser and email client for the MaidSafe data network. By far the most information about MaidSafe has been generated in their blog, forum and GitHub account making them a heavily community driven project. They are a totally distributed team but have started setting up small offices in India and have a large number of core developers in Scotland.

The uses cases for secure decentralized public and private cloud storage are many. I find myself wondering what amount of storage one would need to rent out in order to at least offset the costs of ones own use.

One such use is public records. Documents could be uploaded to storage networks and remain in perpetuity with special contracts that persist across the network.
