![PlantBot]( )    

<center> Experimental home hydroponic system for testing hardware and software related to controlled environment agriculture.</center>

This project was heavily inspired by my work at [STORC](http://csus.edu/storc) the Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center. Also the work at the [Open Agriculture Institute](http://openag.media.mit.edu)

## Architecture
* [resin.io](http://resin.io/)
PLantBot uses [resinOS](https://docs.resin.io/understanding/understanding-devices/2.0.0/) and the resin.io platform. The use of Resin allows PlantBot users the ability to run their projects on any board supported on resinOS. I have run this project on the BeagleBone Black, Intel Edison, Intel NUC and Raspberry Pi 3.

* [node-red](http://nodered.org)
For the application to run PlantBot I have been using the nodeJS javascript platform Node-Red.

* [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.com)
For storing data in the cloud PlantBot uses IBM's cloud platform Bluemix and it's IoT services. Cloudant specifically is based on the noSQL database framework couchDB.
