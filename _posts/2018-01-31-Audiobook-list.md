## Audiobook List

The purpose of this post is to share with you my favorite audiobooks. I have found these to be exceptionally insightful and inspiring. For me, audiobooks are  a way for me to consume new ideas or stories that fuel my growth and thinking. Most recently I have been learning about the blockchain and crypto currencies and the next generation of the internet.

The narrative also helped me think very deeply about the full scope of the paradigm shift that the blockchain promises to create.
