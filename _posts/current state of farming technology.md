What are the [costs](http://irrigation.wsu.edu/Content/Fact-Sheets/Set-Move-Management.pdf) and benefits of retrofitting a water wheel line system *vs.* the costs and benefits of adopting a new irrigation system entirely?
what are the *crops* that benefit most from the sprinkler based wheel line system?
What does the future hold for the wheel line *process*?
Why has [wheel line innovation](http://alfalfa.ucdavis.edu/+symposium/proceedings/1998/98-221.pdf) not *already* occurred?
